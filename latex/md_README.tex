L-\/systems are used for modelling the growth of plants through recursion. This project is an implmentation of an L-\/system in C++11 to render a tree in Open\+GL.

\section*{What is an L-\/\+System?}

L-\/systems, introduced and name after a biologist Lindenmayer, are parallel rewriting systems which use formal languages (generated by context-\/free or context-\/sensitive grammars). An L-\/system consists of the following\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Alphabet\+:} The set of symbols allowed in the language
\item {\bfseries Production rules\+:} A set of rules which define how each symbol can be expanded to a larger string of symbols
\item {\bfseries Axiom\+:} The initial string used for recursive generation
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This may seem similar to fractals, which are a specific kind of l-\/system.

A simple bracketed l-\/system (which allows saving and restoring state) can generate very complex strings which can be interpreted as instructions in turtle-\/like graphics.

\section*{Our L-\/\+System}

The l-\/system we used is a {\bfseries bracketed stochastic 0\+L-\/system}. What this means is that we have a {\itshape context-\/free grammar} as production rules. Stochastic means that there are multiple production rules for a single symbol in our alphabet and there is a finite probability of expanding using each of these.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Alphabet\+:} \{ F, X, \mbox{[}, \mbox{]}, -\/, + \}
\item {\bfseries Production rules\+:}\+:

``` \{ X -\/(0.\+25)-\/$>$ F-\/\mbox{[}\mbox{[}X\mbox{]}+X\mbox{]}+F\mbox{[}\mbox{[}X\mbox{]}+X\mbox{]}-\/X X -\/(0.\+25)-\/$>$ F-\/\mbox{[}\mbox{[}X\mbox{]}+X\mbox{]}+F\mbox{[}-\/\+FX\mbox{]}+X X -\/(0.\+25)-\/$>$ F\mbox{[}+X\mbox{]}\mbox{[}-\/X\mbox{]}FX\char`\"{};
        X -\/(0.\+25)-\/$>$ F\mbox{[}+\+X\mbox{]}\+F\mbox{[}-\/\+X\mbox{]}+\+X\char`\"{};

F -\/$>$ FF \} ```
\item {\bfseries Axiom\+:} \char`\"{}\+X\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\hyperlink{classTurtle}{Turtle} interpretation of symbols}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily F} = Move forward, drawing a line
\item {\ttfamily +} = Rotate head left by $<$angle$>$
\item {\ttfamily -\/} = Rotate head right by $<$angle$>$
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{[}} = Save state of turtle (State\+: x, y, rotation, thickness)
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{]}} = Restore state of turtle
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Other implementation details}

For drawing leaves, the terminal symbol {\ttfamily X} has been used along with the next symbol of the string. If the symbol {\ttfamily X} is encountered, with the following symbol as {\ttfamily \mbox{[}}, then a leaf is drawn.

{\bfseries Branch width contraction} occurs at every branching point in the tree.

{\bfseries Trunk tapering} is performed until the first branch is encountered, after which branch contraction is performed.

Color of leaves is taken from a uniform random distribution, based on a variable used to denote season.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \#\#\#\# Summer/spring 
\item \#\#\#\# Autumn 
\item \#\#\#\# Winter 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Every execution of the program leads to a slightly different tree structure due to the stochastic l-\/system, random angle of branching, and random leaf colors.

\section*{Buidling}

Clone or unzip the project to your favorite folder. Then run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 mkdir build
2 cd build
